-------------------- Algorithm 1 Pseudocode: Greedy Approach to Hamilton Problem -------------------

    set variable X to 0
    set variable Y to size of distances array

    for every city in Y do
      if at first city
        continue
      else
        set variable J to 0
        while j is less than city
          add first element of distance array to the end
          increment j by 1

      for every element in distance array
        if at first element
          Add to X the fuel, at same index as distance, and multiply it by mpg
          continue
        else
          subtract from X the next city's distance
          then add to X, the next fuel multiplied by mpg

      if X is greater than or equal to 0
        return X
      else
        set X to 0
        resume outer for loop

-------------------------- Algorithm 2 Pseudocode:  Matching Group Schedules ------------------------

    remove semicolons from input arrays
    convert string arrays into integer arrays for comparisons
    add one of the daily activities array into the other
    sort the combined integer daily activity array in ascending order
    find the beginning and end time window that both members are available in the entire day
    remove times that either member could not meet in the daily activities array
    create the output array
    append to the output array only the times of the daily activities that meet the duration_of_meeting
    add to the beginning of the output array any free time both could meet that follows the d_of_m & time window schedule
    add to the end of the output array any free time both could meet that follows the d_of_m & time window schedule
    format the output array back to string, and add the semicolon in the correct index
    return output array
