Algorithm 1 Pseudocode: Greedy Approach to Hamilton Problem

    set variable X to 0
    set variable Y to size of distances array

    for every city in Y do
      if at first city
        continue
      else
        set variable J to 0
        while j is less than city
          add first element of distance array to the end
          increment j by 1

      for every element in distance array
        if at first element
          Add to X the fuel, at same index as distance, and multiply it by mpg
          continue
        else
          subtract from X the next city's distance
          then add to X, the next fuel multiplied by mpg

      if X is greater than or equal to 0
        return X
      else
        set X to 0
        resume outer for loop
